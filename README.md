Sources for the tasks `rms` and `rms-fixed` from Teaser DragonCTF 2019.
The unfixed version didn't have the zero ip checks.


Please excuse the extremely poor quality of this code - I made this task basically in a single evening. We also considered releasing the sources, so the comments were omitted to not make it too easy.

### Task Description

I generally do not connect to web sites from my own machine,
aside from a few sites I have some special relationship with.
I usually fetch web pages from other sites by sending mail
to a program that fetches them, much like wget, and then mails them back to me.
